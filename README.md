EMPLOYEE DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT:
This is my first Data analysis project completely based on SQL.

This dataset contains information about employees in a company.
This dataset is available in 6 tables-
employees: basic employee information
salaries: salary details for each employee
titles: Job titles held by employees
departments: information about different departments
dept_emp: records of employee assignments to departments
dept_manager: records of managers within departments.
This dataset can be used for various HR and workforce-related analyses.

Initially, data has been cleaned and preprocessed to ensure consistency and accuracy.
